# Software Licensing FAQ

## General Questions

### Q: Do I need an internet connection to use the software?
**A:** No, the software works fully offline once set up. You only need an internet connection for:
- Initial model download during setup
- Checking for and downloading model updates (automatic when available)
- Without internet, the SDK will use your existing downloaded model

### Q: Can I use my license on multiple computers?
**A:** Yes! All licenses have no limits on the number of computers. You can use them on multiple computers simultaneously.

## License Types & Renewal

### Q: What types of licenses are available?
**A:** We offer three license types in two versions:

**License Duration:**
- Monthly licenses
- Yearly licenses  
- Lifetime licenses

**License Versions:**
- **V1 License:** Access to V13 and legacy models
- **V2 License:** Access to all models including V14 with Crystal v2.4.0 support

### Q: How does license renewal work?
**A:** 
- **Monthly and Yearly licenses:** Must be renewed before expiration. We'll send new keys before your license expires, giving you time to update and avoid any service interruption. Each license includes approximately 10 extra days as a buffer.
- **Lifetime licenses:** No expiration date - use indefinitely without any renewal needed.

### Q: When will I receive my renewal key?
**A:** New license keys are sent before your current license expires, ensuring you have adequate time to update without any service interruption.

## Service Continuity

### Q: What happens if your service discontinues?
**A:** We're committed to our users. If our service ever discontinues, we will either:
- Open-source the code, or
- Provide lifetime licenses to all active users

This ensures you'll always have access to the software you've invested in.

## Refund Policy

### Q: What is your refund policy?
**A:** We offer a full refund guarantee with the following conditions:
- **Before serial key delivery:** Full refund available if requested before your serial key is sent to your email
- **After serial key delivery:** Refunds cannot be processed once the serial key has been issued and sent to your email
- **Why this policy?** Serial keys work completely offline and cannot be remotely deactivated once issued, making it impossible to revoke access after delivery

### Q: How can I test before purchasing?
**A:** We strongly encourage testing before purchase:
- Use our **free test API** to evaluate the software capabilities
- Try our **live test website** to see the software in action
- These testing options ensure the software meets your needs before committing to a purchase

### Q: Can I use V14 models with a V1 license?
